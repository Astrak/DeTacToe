# DeTacToe
This repo contains the code for a WIP tic-tac-toe game to experiment with solidity and gamefi concepts.

## Description
The implementation runs as follows: 
1. an address sends a bet to the contract to tease another player. It can be renounced or cancelled.
1. another address can pick the game and the contract starts it if the bet is identical
1. The one winning the game gets the money.

## Todo
1. complete the game's core logic
1. do a nice front-end
1. deploy the contract and the website to prod platforms
