# DeTacToe

Welcome to DeTacToe, the decentralized tic tac toe! One can use it to bet money on a game against a remote opponent and use the blockchain to ensure the bet is enforced.

The master implementation is live at [here](https://detactoe.surge.sh) using the Goerli testnet and its fake money.

This app is thought as a personal demo to experiment the current blockchain tech stack and perhaps reuse boilerplate code.

## Code

This repo contains the code for a tic-tac-toe game on the Goerli blockchain or a local Ganache blockchain. The app uses Vite, Vue3, Vuex, Typescript, Typechain, Truffle and Web3.js.

## Todo

1. hardhat contract page interaction generation for solidity dev?
1. Try out on a faster network than EVM?
1. Fix Microsoft Edge responsiveness
1. Add github action with linting and testing
1. Fix player not finishing the game
1. Add oracle to add randomness to who plays first
